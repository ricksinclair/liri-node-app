### About LIRI

LIRI or Language Interpretation Recognition Interface is a multipurpose commandline search tool.
This app was designed in a modular fashion in order to allow for quick debugging and added future functionality

### installation

Download or clone repository and then build using the following:

```
npm install

```

All dependencies will install & then you'll have access to the following commands:

- `concert-this`

- `spotify-this-song`

- `movie-this`

- `do-what-it-says`

You would invoke each by doing the following:

```
concert-this [artist name]

spotify-this-song [ song name]

movie-this [movie name]

do-what it says

```

`NOTE`: The `do-what-it-says` command relies on input from a text file named random.txt placed at the root of the application directory
